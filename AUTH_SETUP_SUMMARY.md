# Authentication Setup - Quick Start

## What's Been Implemented âœ“

Your complete authentication system is now ready!

### Features Working:
1. âœ… Email/Password Sign Up with email verification
2. âœ… Email verification via callback handler
3. âœ… Login with session management
4. âœ… Logout functionality
5. âœ… Protected routes (dashboard, etc.)

7. âœ… Remember redirect path after login

## Test Your Authentication

### Option 1: Test Locally

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to:
http://localhost:3000
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Click "Get Started" â†’ Sign Up
2. Enter email & password
3. Check your email for verification link
4. Click verification link
5. Login with your credentials
6. You'll see the dashboard!

### Option 2: Deploy & Test

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "Add authentication system"
git push

# Then visit your Vercel URL
```

## Important: Supabase Email Settings

Before testing, configure Supabase email redirects:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dtgxsrpxxdhzjaxevhwp/auth/url-configuration

2. Add these Redirect URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/*
   https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/auth/callback
   https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/*
   ```

3. Set Site URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000              # For development
   https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app # For production
   ```

## Pages Available

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

## What's Next?

Now that authentication is working, you can:

1. **Build Note Features**
   - CRUD operations for notes
   - Markdown editor
   - Note list view

2. **Add Tagging System**
   - Create/manage tags
   - Tag notes
   - Filter by tags

3. **Implement AI Profiles**
   - Create AI automation rules
   - Execute AI on tagged notes

## Troubleshooting

### Email Verification Not Working?
- Check Supabase redirect URLs are configured
- Verify email template has `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
- Check spam folder for verification email

### Can't Login After Verification?
- Ensure email is verified in Supabase dashboard
- Check for typos in email/password
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Session Not Persisting?
- Make sure cookies are enabled
- Check middleware is running (should see in terminal logs)
- Verify environment variables are set
